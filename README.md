# ramuda

Functional programming helper library based on Ramda.js

As far as I know, this is the most feature complete (though there are still some gaps) port of Ramda.js for PHP with over 300 functions. Also, includes many functions from [Ramda Adjunct](https://char0n.github.io/ramda-adjunct/2.24.0/RA.html) and [Ramda Extension](https://ramda-extension.firebaseapp.com/docs/).

In addition, where possible, some of the functions have improved capabilities, such as **filter** and **map** handling strings and objects as well as the usual arrays.

Requires PHP 5.6 or higher.
